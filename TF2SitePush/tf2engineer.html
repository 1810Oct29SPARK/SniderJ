The engineer is noted for his duality of being one of the weakest classes initally but one of the strongest once he is fully set up. The Engineer has the unique ability
to build a Sentry, Dispenser, and pair of Teleporters to suport his team. The sentry is an automated turret with great aim and good damage, able to take down most classes
with ease unless they're adequately prepared. The dispenser provides teammates with health and ammo, and he teleporter moves an ally from an entrance to an exit when its fully
charged. Each of these buildings can be upgraded up to level 3 by hitting them with any allied engineer's wrench, increasing their capabilities and efficiency. while his buildings
aren't indestructable once fully upgraded, it takes a team effort to take them down, and an engineer can cover an entire area on his own reliably givent he time to build up. However,
the engineer himself does very poor in combat. His personal damage output is moderate and predictable, with both a shotgun and pistol, and his durability is tied with the scout,sniper,
 and spy for the lowest. Also, a dead engineer can do nothing to repair or defend his buildings from enemies, making them easy pickings, especially for Soldiers, Demomen, and Spies.
 A good engineer makes sure all his buildings stay in top condition so his allies have a reliable area to recover and rest in, and a good team keeps their engineers safe 
 to let them do their work. If a team has multiple engineers, they can work on and upgrade each others buildings, letting them get twice the firepower in half the time.
 The Engineer's unlockables give him a few different ways to benefit or work without his buildings, such as giving his shotgun some extra power after his sentry is destroyed
 to help him repel those that destroyed it, or even a gun that shoots small healing darts to heal his building from afar in exchange for lowering his already mediocre personal offensive
 capabilities.

The Engineer is visually very noticeable thanks to his yellow hard hat and knee gaurds, and his vulnerability can be noticed in his lack of protective gear meant for the battlefield. His
buildings are brightly colored in his team, and have similarly colered effects surrounding them.  Personality wise, the Engineer is very easy going and prefers to let his buildings do the work,
becoming upset and frustrated when they stop working or are destroyed. Many of his taunts and cosmetics also reference his home state of Texas, and some of them show his easygoing side, the most
noticeable one having him build a chair and parasol and then relaxing while drinking a beer.
