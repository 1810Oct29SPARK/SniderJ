The Medic is the primary healing class of the game, and no team is generally complete without one. His medigun allows him to select a player within a decent range and provide that player
with a steady stream of healing. This beam is very forgiving in terms of reach, and can even reach around corners, allowing the medic to avoid direct fire behind cover. Players already at full health
can be "overcharged" to up to 150% of their maximum health through medigun healing, and while this wears off after some time, it can be used to give the medic's allies a burst of initial durability.
The medic's most powerful ability is to perform an "ubercharge," where depending on which medigun is being used, provide the ally being healed with a massive buff in attack or defense. This power
is charged by healing, takes some time to charge, and is lost upon death of the medic, encouraging a defensive playstyle and to regularly heal allies. In exchange for these tide-changing abilities,
Medics are virtually worthless in direct combat with an enemy. The medic has slightly more health than a scout and is just barely slower, but this speed is best used to retreat than move forward.
 Their syringe gun has a large clip size but does little damage that takes awhile to accumulate, and its projectiles can be hard to aim as 
they are relatively slow and move in an arc that quickly degrades, meaning to hit even at medium distances the player has to account for dropoff.Their only other weapon is a bonesaw
that while dangerous also puts the medic at extreme risk. The medic's abilities also make him a high value target for the other team regardless of circumstances, and Scouts, Snipers, and Spies 
will hound him to no end. A good medic spreads his healing evenly, recognizing when a teammate is in danger of dying and acting accordingly. Good medics generally follow classes with a lot of firepower
to the front line for protection and to find the most likely source of injured teammates. In exchange, a good team knows that an alive medic keeps the whole team alive, and should be willing to defend
them at all costs, even at the risk of their own life.

Visually, the Medic is very noticeable even on a chaotic battlefield thanks to their mostly white coat and outfit, showing both allies and enemies where he is 
even from far distances. His colored gloves also clash visually with darker medigun, and the medigun itself makes a very visually noteiceable beam when it is on. Further more, ubercharged players turn
a bright metallic sheen indicating they are impervious to damage and are to be generally avoided. Personality wise the Medic could most easily described as an example 
of the cliche mad scientist. Allusions to godhood and maniacal cackling are common when he and his healing partner are doing well in combat. The medic loves to make 
references to his medical prowess in his taunts and actions, and many of his cosmetics also make reference to his german heritage.
