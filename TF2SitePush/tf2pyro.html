Of the 3 Offensive classes, the Pyro is in the middle in terms of movement and health, being fairly more durable than a scout but also much slower. The Pyro's
main weapon is a flamethrower, and with this comes all the strengths and disadvantages one would expect of it. In terms of raw firepower, few classes can achieve
what the pyro can put out and none can do it as easily as him. Even at the very edge of his short range, where the flame is the weakest, every class will have little
time to react to a Pyro attacking them and will either die or have very little health remaining. Being caught at point blank range is almost always a death sentence. In
exchange, the flamethrower has a pitiful range and can be easily countered in most cases by running away, as while he's not the slowest class by far the pyro simply
can't catch up to many classes should they decide to retreat. Enemies that are hit by the flamethrower(or any of the pyro's other flame based weapons) take some damage
over time as well, and while this can be cured or mitigated, it allows a pyro to engage an enemy, retreat, and have them continue to suffer damage while the pyro
safely disengages. Players that are on fire are visually very easy to notice and indicate to friends of the Pyro that an enemy is particulary weak, making them an easy
target. The pyro can also blast compressed air out of his flamethrower for a variety of uses. allies that are on fire can be extinguised by this air blast, and
enemies are pushed back by it, which a smart pyro can use to push them into dangerous or deadly areas. This move can also be used to reflect projectiles such as 
rockets and gernades with an increase in damage to boot, meaning Soldiers and Demos must be wary of when they fire their main weapons around pyros lest they manage
to kill themselves. This projectile reflection can be used to defend players as well, especially engineers and their buildings. The Pyro carries a shotgun that has a slightly better range
 in exchange for less power for picking off retreating enemies and a fire ax as a melee weapon. His unlockables include more variety of flamethrower and a set of flare guns that technically
 have very fair ranges that let Pyros set enemies ablaze from even far distances but in reality are easy to dodge if the enemy is attentive.
  A good pyro makes up for his short range by preparing ambushes where enemies are forced to engage at the short ranges he prefers and uses his airblast and 
  afterburn effects to support his team in a variety of ways. Many classes (including the pyro himself) have a variety of weapons that deal extra damage or have added
  effects if used against enemies that are on fire, so working with your team using these weapons can be devastating.

The Pyro, being in the middle in terms of durability, visually is wearing some minor protection in terms of his fireproof-suit and the gear he carries. Much
of the pyro's personality is that he is an enigma, with even his sex being up in the air, and this is represented by his body being fully covered in gear with
no view of his skin. This also makes the pyro extremely visually distinct thanks to the black covering much of his person, which is important considering his massive firepower. Many of the Pyro's animations
and taunts reflect his fractured and psychotic personality, as well as his infatuation with fire, such as filling a kiddie pool with gasoline and playing
 in it wit ha rubber duck. His cosmetic items go all over the place in terms of tone,
but most of them would only be worn by someone of a very unsound mindset even in the TF2 universe, such as rubber gloves, bird cages, and melting candles. The Pyro's bodysuit being fully colored means that his usually
darker primary weapon, the flamethrower, clashes distinctively with his body, making it clear to enemies he is not to be messed with while wielding it. The flamethrower
is also massive in size, reflecting both its power and again making it visually distinct.
