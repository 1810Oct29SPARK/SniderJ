the demo is middling in both speed and durability, matching the pyro in health while being just slightly slower. AS his name would imply, almost all of his weapons are 
explosivs in one way or another. His primary weapon is a grenade launcher that is similar to the Soldier's rocket launcher but fires its projectiles in an arc. Also,
these grenades only detonate on direct hits; hitting a surface first means they will bounce off and then detonate after a short time. This allows the demoman to make
powerful, indirect attacks, especially against heavily entrenched enemies that are grouped together. shooting over a wall into an enemy area means the demoman can hassle
and if he's lucky even kill enemy players without even seeing them or having to worry about return fire. The demoman also has a sticky bomb launcher that places charges
along whatever surface they are shot at, and will remain there until detonated at his command. The obvious application for this is area denial. Placing sticky bombs
outside of doors or around corners will allow the demoman to make powerful attacks against enemies that usually won't be able to attack in time. However, because his grenades
can be difficult to aim directly at moving targets, and his sticky bombs requiring watchful eyes for the perfect time to detonate, the Demoman usually prefers to hang back
and defend an area as opposed to actively attacking, although the full power of a bunch of sticky bombs going off at once in an enemy area can be powerful if the demoman is 
given the oppurtunity to pull it off, especially against enemy engineers who can neither save their buildings from the blast and will most likely die in the explosion regardless
due to their usual short proximity to their buildings. While most classes' unlockable weapons are simply variants on their usual playstyle, the Demoman is rather unique
in that he has a set of medieval weaponry and targes that he can equip to change up his entire playstyle, going from defensive to extremely offensive, basically qualifying as a tenth class. Melee-based demos
behave almost entirely like pyros in that while their specialized melee weapons have longer range than normal melee weapons, they are still outdone by virtually any gun, so most
Demoknights (as they are usually referred to) will perform around the corner and behind the back ambushes to get within melee range, or use their specialized charge.
Any demo wearing one of his shields gets a charge ability that lets them cover massive amounts of ground in a straight line, along with a massive melee damage boost 
at the end of the charge. On top of this, most of the demo's special melee weapons grant some kind of boon on getting a kill, usually health or recharging their charge
special immediately, the idea being that a demo will use his charge to get into the fray, get a kill, and then use that buff to string several kills together in the chaos.
A good demo will use the terrain and his grenade's arc to annoy and disrupt enemies and keep them out of important areas. This includes sticky trapping doorways and corners
to catch large groups of combatants off-gaurd. A good demoknight recognizes the crippling specialization he has and tries not to charge into areas expecting him or
that are heavily gaurded. Picking off lone enemies to gather buffs and then turning towards larger prey is generally the best strategy.

The most immediate character trait of the Demoman is that he's consistently drunk. Regular remarks to his alchohol stash are common, and many jabs at the stereotype of
the drunk scotsman are taken. His loves of explosives and short temper also show up in several of his cosmetics and taunts, with one of them even having the demo ripping the top
off a grenade, opening a bottle of alchohol, and pouring both into his mouth. The demo wears a moderate amount of protection both to show his affinity for explosives
and middling speed and health. His projectiles are very noticeable, being bright colors of his team and even glowing to represent the immediate danger they are.
