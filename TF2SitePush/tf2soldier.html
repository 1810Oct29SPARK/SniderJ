The Soldier is the second heaviest character in terms of Max Health and speed, being beaten by only the heavy in terms of higher health and lower quickness. In exchange
for this lack of mobility, the soldier is equipped with a rocket launcher with a very long range, high damage, and the ability to hit multiple enemies with the explosion.
The Soldier's most notable ability is to perform a "rocket jump," where he jumps, crouches, and fire a rocket at his feet. Depending on the timing of the crouch, jump, and fire,
the soldier can launch himself at a variety of speeds and angles over long distances and take paths that even the scout cannot. However, this move costs the soldier some
health, so smart players balance this maneuver with how much health remains so as to not reach the fight at a disadvantage. unlike other Offensive classes, the soldier's health
and raw firepower means that he can stay in extended combat for a longer period of time, although his rockets become extremely easy to avoid at longer than medium ranges where they also deal much less damage, and at
short ranges he can hurt himself with the explosions from his rockets, leaving him dead or very weakened. His rockets also take some time to reload, and being caught off gaurd
can be devastating to a him. A good soldier uses his health to defend weaker classes (such as Medics and Engineers) while using his powerful explosions to punish foes that are grouped
together. Because buildings aren't affected by fall-off (the mechanic where players that get hit by projectiles take less damage from it if the player launching it was far away) means that
soldiers also excel at taking out engineer nests. The soldier also comes equipped with a shotgun meant to take out weakened enemies at close ranges dangerous to use or reload the shotgun
and a trench shovel with which to bludgeon foes. The soldier's unlockable items involve more varities of rocket launchers and a series of banners that allow him to buff
allies around him for a little while.

The soldier is certifiably insane, bloodthirsty, and merciless, with many of his taunts and actions being reminiscent of the hardened drill sergeant at boot camp
in so many war movies. He regularly calls foe and friend alike "maggot" and yells about how the many ways he will tear the enemy apart. all of this is meant to tie
into his survivability and the rocket jump ability, both things only someone missing a few screws would even consider a good idea. The soldier is also one of the stockier
classes in the game, with his big coat emphasizing his chest and arms to show off his power and durability. The goofiness of his eyes being covered in virtually every
cosmetic he can get also reinforces his insanity, as again, no one in their right mind goes into a firefight blind. The soldier also makes several references to the American
armed forces in his taunts and actions, the most famous one being his mock salute.
