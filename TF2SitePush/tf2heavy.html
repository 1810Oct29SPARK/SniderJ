The heavy is both the most durable and slowest class in the game, taking a very long time to get to any fighting but becoming an immediate threat when he does arrive. His 
Minigun has some of the highest damage in the game. While wildly inaccurate, its raw output of bullets means that anyone not very far away will take extreme and deadly damage.
In exchange, the minigun requires about 2 seconds to rev up and actually start firing bullets. The sound for this is very distinctive, and it reduces the heavey's poor movement
speed to an even slower pace, making him an extremely easy target for classes out his range, especially snipers. Heavies can preemptively rev up their minigun without actually
firing to prepare for incoming enemies, and smart heavies will act similarly to Pyros by waiting around corners and doorways to engage at their preferred range. The heavy also
carries a shotgun which can be used against singular targets to save minigun ammo and retain some mobility, and his preferred melee weapon is his giant fists. On paper, the 
Heavy is one of the easisest classes to  start playing with a general lack of complexity to his style. However, good Heavies will know to read the situation and when they should absorb fire
that other teammates simply can't and knowing when even they are in over their head, and this is a skill that isn't easy to master. Good Heavies also know to rely on their teammates
to help them get to the front lines faster where he can be the force that a heavy is, usually through Engineer teleporters, but sometimes by taking speed buffs offered by other players.
Heavy unlockables are some variation on his playstyle save for a series of lunchbox items that help his durability in some way, providing health in exchange for requiring a few moments
of defenselessness while they're eaten to allow a heavy to stay in a fight unassisted.

The most immediately noticeable thing about the heavy is his size. phyiscally the largest class, his speed and health are noticeable from appearances alone. On top of his weight, he's
also wearing a black protective vest that clashes visually with the white body of his minigun to let enemy players know he's equipped and ready. Many of his taunts and actions also
reference his love for his weaponry, which he even affectionately names. Some cosmetics and taunts to his Russian heritage are also present, as well as his massive strength.
