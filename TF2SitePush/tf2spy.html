The Spy is a class based on espionage and trickery, with several unique abilities. His cloaking watch allows him to become temporarily invisible, and his Disguise kit allows
him to look like a member of the enemy team, a trick that even Sentries are fooled by. Furthermore, the spy's melee weapon (a balisong, or butterfly knife) has the unique ability
for a one-hit kill if attacking an enemy from the back. This trick cannot be performed if this spy is invisble, and if he's disguised the disguise is removed, and the killed class makes
a very loud sound, making the spy's presence immediately known, generally meaning he must retreat quickly with his invisibility. The spy also has the unique ability to see enemy health, which is
useful to relay to his allies what targets are particularly weak. The Spy can also disable and slowly destroy enemy buildings by placing a device called a sapper on them. While any Engineer can remove these
, He can't do so if dead, making engineers one of the spies top targets.  Unfortunately, once discovered, the spy has next to no direct offensive capability. His revolver is strong, but quickly loses
damage with range, and is relatively slow and innaccurate. His knife is also useless when not backstabbing and is easily the weakest melee weapon in the game.Furthermore, Pyro's will regularly check
corners and suspicious teammates with their flamethrower. Allied players are fine, but spies will be immediately set ablaze, making them visully extremely obvious. The flame damage, combined with the spy's already
horrid health, usually means that once discovered he's dead. A good spy watches the enemy team and acts like an enemy while disguised, avoiding pyros, relaying information to his team, and taking out high
value targets like medics and snipers. Most of the spies unlockables provide different ways of sneaking into enemy lines, including faking his own death.

The Spy is all about professionalism. From his sharp suit to his sharp wit and snark even on a battlefield. The spy loves to make fun of the lack of class his enemies have,
and boast about his own ability to take advantage of the enemy's lack of awareness. His pinstripe suit not only clearly does not belong in any fight, but its unique, darker shade makes
him more noticeable when he's not disguised or invisible, especially with the dark balaclava he wears over his head. Many of the spy's actions and taunts also reference
his home contry of France and all the sterotypes within, with many berets available to him and one taunt involving taking a cushy seat on the battlefield and enjoying a 
cup of wine with a good book. Many of his other cosmetics are different stylish suits and accessories.
