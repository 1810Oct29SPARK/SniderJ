The scout is the fastest class in TF2 with both the highest movement speed and the ability to double jump,
an ability only he possesses. The Scout's primary playstyle is to use his speed and
maneuverability to avoid enemy fire and get extremely close where his main weapon the Scattergun can deal massive
amounts of damage. Virtually no class can ignore or shrug off the scout at point blank range and many of the less
defensive ones can die in two shots from point blank range. However, the scout is also tied for the lowest health amongst
all classes and so he is generally a high risk class to play. Good Scouts know to use their speed to reach paths off-limits to other classes and go after classes
at their weakest, and he's one of the better classes to go after high-value targets such as Medics or Engineers
because even if he does die from the effort, his high speed allows him to get back to the front lines faster while
Medics and Engineers either must make a long trek back to the front lines or rely on teammates for faster movement.
The scout also has a pistol to annoy enemies into paying attention to him and pick off targets at medium distance that are trying
to get away, and a bat that in exchange for dealing less damage than other melee weapons swings much faster.
While the scout has several unlockable weapons and support items, all of them are variants on getting around and past enemies
and into the short ranges he prefers before blasting them away.

The Scout and his snarky, in-your-face attitude reflect his playstyle of hassling and distracting enemy players, and many of his taunts reinforce this
by having him make fun of the enemy and boast about his quickness. The scout also has several weapons and cosmetics that feature baseball, a favorite sport of
his that also emphasizes quick bursts of speed and light clothing compared to other sports. The Scout's shirt (either red or blue, depending on team) is meant
to visually clash with the darker color of most of his primary weapons (virtually all of them shotguns) and he holds his bat in such a matter as to make it very
obvious he's holding a melee weapon, allowing players to easily and immediately tell what distance to engage the scout at whenever he approaches.
In gameplay terms, the scout is the fastest and lightest class in the game, and this is represented visually by his overall lack of protection.
He shows the most  bare skin of any class and wears light clothing meant to emphasize his quickness. The scout is also probably the slimmest
class in the game save for maybe the Spy. Virtually all of the scout's animations are faster than the other classes, with his running animation being the most
obvious with how fast he moves his feet, along with his jump and double jump which feature him moving his feet all over the place.
