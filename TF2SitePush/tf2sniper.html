The sniper is best noted for his ability to take out enemies reliably and effectively from a distance most classes can't even attack from. Scoping in with his rifle
allows him to charge his shot, and hitting the head of an opponent while scoped in is a gaurenteed critical hit for 3 times more damage. A fully charged headshot is capable
of killing any class save for extreme circumstances. Even a heavy with overheal from a medic will  fall from a fully charged headshot. The sniper's range and power lets him take
out high value targets that are otherwise hard to approach, namely enemy medics and heavies. In exchange for this, The sniper is hindered at medium and close range combat,
where headshots can be hard to land, and scoping in greatly reduces his field of vision. His submachine gun does mediocre damage that is easily shrugged off, and while his kukri (curved hunting knife)
is dangerous, the sniper's lack of durability means its an all or nothing gamble. A good sniper stays back from the fight and uses his line of sight to pick off targets that
will hinder his team most, and also calls out enemy movement thanks to his view of the battlefield. Many of the sniper's unlockables are a variety of rifles, but the most noticeable
one is Jarate, the Jar-based Karate. The sniper takes a jar of his urine created while staked out for long hours in an area and can throw it for a small area of effect splash.
Enenimes hit by this take 35% more damage, and allies that are on fire can be extinguished. A good sniper uses Jarate to help his team indirectly by hitting enemies at ranges
he personally would have trouble dealing with, and extinguish teammates in situations of life-or-death where other forms of curing the blaze can't be found.

The sniper's vulnerability and preferred playstyle can be inferred by his build. He wears light clothing meant to be as unrestrictive as possible, and he is actually the tallest
class in the game despite his slim appearance, referencing both his fragility and preference for long lines of sight. The sniper rifle displays a dot of the snipers color on whatever
surface he is looking at, giving enemy teams fair warning that he's looking in their direction, and smart snipers will hide this dot by looking at a surface adjacent to the area they actually
want to shoot at before firing. The Sniper loves to call out enemies on their inferior aim (especially enemy snipers), and generally just loves to insult the enemy. Many of his cosmetics
and taunts mock how unfit for combat his foes are. His cosmetic items generally reference figures and military units in history known for sharpshooting, and many also make references to his
australian heritage.
