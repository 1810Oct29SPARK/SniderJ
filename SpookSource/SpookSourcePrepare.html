                        There's nothing wrong with a healthy interest in the paranormal, and some of the braver of us even want a firsthand account 
                        of the things that go bump in the night. That's fine, but PLEASE read the preperations below before going to the <a href="SpookSourceSpookMap.html">Spook Map</a>,

                                There's nothing scarier than the red tape of the US legal system! Regardless of what you hear about a location and how abandon it is, chances
                                are SOMEONE owns whatever land you want to check out, and going on property someone owns without their permission is trespassing. Even property that is abandon
                                is illegal to enter if something designed to keep people out is present (fences, padlocks, or NO TRESPASSING signs). If an abandon buliding has none of these
                                barriers and is clearly not in use, in the legal sense you are usually ok, but the safest legal route is to at least ask for permission from whoever owns the land (unless that happens
                                to be the government, in which case it will always be a certain "no," and trespassing on their land will haunt you with legal issues even the best
                                ghost would have trouble topping).

                                Unfortunatly visitors from the other side like to hang out in some pretty dangerous places, so fully understand what you are getting yourself into when
                                you venture into any abandon man-made structures. Stairs can collapse, walls can fall over, and all kinds of animals and bugs could call the place home.
                                Going alone is frankly an awful idea; if anything happens, you want at least one other person there to get help. Going into any of these places with bare skin is generally
                                a bad idea. Wear enough to cover yourself against scrapes and splinters. Because paranormal activity seems to prefer coming out in the evenings, make sure you bring a strong light
                                source (cellphones don't count, folks.) and stay aware of your surroundings. Everyone should have a fully-charged cellphone in case anyything happens (and to take pictures of
