                <p>If you'd rather leave the ghost hunting to the people that know what they're doing, we don't blame you! Any city with a decent history is going 
                    to have a few disgruntled past residents, and Tampa is no exception. Here's a list of paranormal tours you can take in the Tampa area. Click
                    on any image for the tour to be taken to their own website.

                                Ybor City is a district of Tampa located Northeast of Downtown that was founded in 1880. Ybor city was noted for having a massive
                                immigrant population and for housing many cigar manufacturing plants, giving it the nickname "Cigar City." Once the Great Depression hit,
                                demand for cigars plummuted and the area was never the same, with residents leaving for greener pastures and many buildings left abandon.
                                However, some residents from so long ago are still there today, in a sense...
