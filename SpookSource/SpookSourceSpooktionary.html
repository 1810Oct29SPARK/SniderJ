                                A ghost is a blanket term for a soul without a body. Origins for ghosts vary widely and some variant of ghost exists in virtually every culture.
                                Similarly, ghosts can have a variety of intents, from simply causing paranormal activity to seeking assistance to directly attacking the living.
                                Ghosts are generally described as appearing translucent and being made of a misty, wispy substance. Depending on the origin and its actions, ghosts
                                can enter any of a number of more defined categories. Poltergeists, for example, are ghosts that are invisible to the naked eye and are generally directly
                                malicious, causing bite marks to appear on humans, tripping them, and even levitating and throwing objects with intent to harm. Common origins for ghosts include
                                as soul lingering on the earth due to an intense grudge or misjustice against it in life that prevents it from going to the afterlife, as well as being forcibly drawn
                                into the world through necromancy or a seance. Perhaps the most dangerous ghost is known as a Revenant, where a soul is so wicked in life won't even
                                let death stop its from causing suffering, so it reanimates its old body, similar to a zombie.

                                The most popular depiction of a demon in modern media are humanoid creatures generally bright red skin, goat horns, and 
                                massive bat wings. Outside of mainstream media however, they are very rarely depicted like this. This appearance most likely 
                                derives from the Christian belief that demons are simply angels that rebelled against god, so to make them more visually 
                                distinct and to contrast with angels, devils are given their traditionally scary appearance. Devils come in a variety of appearances
                                and ther concept of them exist in several cultures, and while most of them are described as inherently dangerous creatures, not all cultures refer to them as such,
                                with Greek and Egyptian cultures claiming they were merely messangers and spirits and were just as free to choose good or evil as any human. Many cultures don't give
                                devils any solid visual appearance(similarly to a ghost) except they are intelligent and work for some higher power, but the cultures
                                that do describe their appearance regularly have them as human in shape but with animal limbs and features. Goat legs, horns, and faces are very common, as are wings
                                similar to either a bat or bird. Demons are generally described as having access to powerful abilities and magic that can grant humans their desires but are usually described
                                as only using these powers to help humans to further the demon's own agenda or in a very unfair trade for the human. The large exception to this
                                is the Japanese demon, otherwise known as an Oni, which are described as large, powerful brutes that love to cause havoc and eat humans, although even now
                                they are quickly gaining reputations as brutish but benevolent protectors that use their strength to ward off bad luck.

                                        Witches (female) and Warlocks(male) are human beings that practice magic (sometimes called Sorcery). Most cultures regard Witchcraft as ineffective at best and dangerous at worst, especially
                                        most european cultures that believe it is directly tied to contacting demons and other malevolent spirits and is therefore tied to The Devil. Some cultures,
                                        however, regard witchcraft as no more inherently evil than any other profession. Depending on where the witch is from, their process for casting and using spells can vary widly.
                                        Some simply use any of a variety of divination techniques to tell the future for themselves or a client (Tarot cards, Ouija boards, and crystal balls being probably the most well known methods)
                                        while others can indirectly cause harm to a target by contacting evil spirits to haunt them, usually through a pact or deal with the spirit. Much like anything else paranormal, whether Witchcraft
                                        even exists and is effective can't be easily proven, but this hasn't stopped Witchcraft from having a massive impact on human culture, such as the variety of witch-hunts that took place
                                        between 1500 and 1800. Even in modern times, some societies closely relate illness to magic and witchcraft, which can make it hard for people trying to provide
                                        medical aid to explain what illness actually is.
