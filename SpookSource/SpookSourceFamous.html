                <p>Paranormal events have been reported for as long as humanity has been able to record them, but some of them stick out a lot more than others, either because
                    of the circumstances leading to the creation of the myths surrounding them or simply because word of mouth spread them so far. Below, you'll find some of the most
                    famous haunts known to man.

                                Sailors are regularly regarded as a supersticious lot, but seeing the Flying Dutchman would make even the most skeptical sailor quake in his boots. According to legend,
                                The Flying Dutchman was a Dutch Man-Of-War that was caught in a terrible storm while at sea one evening. The crew begged the captain to head to the nearest port, but he wouldn't
                                listen, and even dared God himself to strike down the ship. The storm succeeded in taking the ship and the life of every man on board, but The Flying Dutchman sails on forever and is not allowed
                                to make port as punishment for defying God. Sightings of the ship would pop up every so often since the story first started in the late 1700s. witnesses claimed that it looks
                                similar to The Flying Dutchman save for a translucent appearance and glowing lights along its length. Witnesses disagree if there is anyone on board the Dutchman but those
                                that claimed to have seen its crew say they are in a similar appearance to the rest of the ship. Seeing the Flying Dutchman is generally seen as a sign of imminent doom for everyone on board
                                a ship, and whether you believe that or not, the sight of such a massive unexplained phenomenon would at least make it pretty hard to focus on any ship work.

                                Arguably one of the most famous ghosts in the modern world, if only because of the game associated with it. "Bloody Mary" is supposedly the ghost of
                                Queen Mary I of England. Mary earned the nickname "Bloody Mary" in reference to her handling of the ongoing protestant reformation in England at the time, which
                                involved the execution or exiling of several hundred Protestant followers. Bloody Mary can traditionally be summoned by saying her name multiple times (the most common
                                number is 3 but some people say it has to be 13) into a mirror in a room with no light or lit only by candles. What exactly happens when she is summoned varies but it is usually a physical
                                attack on her summoner, such as strangling them or clawing out their eyes. The Bloody Mary ritual exists today as a popular way of seeing just how committed your skeptical friend is 
                                to their lack of belief in the paranormal. After all, if ghosts aren't real, then summoning Bloody Mary won't bring a bloodthirsty phantom into the physical realm, right? Many
                                a participant has gotten to saying her name twice in the mirror and then simply faltering at the third time.

                                        The White House has its fair share of spectral residents that stick around long after their time, but on top of being one of the most 
                                        famous and well-respected Presidents to have served in the White House, Lincoln is probably the most well known spectre to still walk its halls.
                                        Many a visitor to the White House report seeing a spectral version of Abraham Lincoln, sometimes even wearing his famous Stovepipe Hat. Some of these
                                        visitors include Eleanor Roosevelt and Winston Churchhill. Despite the eeriness of a former president haunting the White House for so long, many believe
                                        that he is a beneficial spirit that insists on continuing to serve the country even after death.
